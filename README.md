This is a quick protoype of Pong I coded in a couple of hours while travelling from Berlin to Prague to practice some JS. It was totally unplanned and started like a joke, so things got added in realtime as the code progressed. As result, there's a lot to fix and loose ends aimed to add features that didn't make it to the first version (but yet it works!).

I also know that there's a lot to refactor, but I wanted to publish this without modifying it beyond commenting it so anyone interested in this kind of things can take a look at the code.

I'd like to continue working on this project at some point and add more things, but you know how those things work, so let's leave it as a proof of concept right now.

If you're interested in getting any help or explanation of **why** or **how**, feel free to contact me, but also mind that I have other things going on and could take me some time to get back.

**ENJOY!**
